# NARS-FighterPlane (Windows)
NARS-FighterPlane is a game in which NARS serves as an AI 
controlling a fighter plane to hit enemy planes.

## Preparation
1. Install Python 3 (my python version is 3.8) and pygame package. To use python in the command window, it should be added to the PATH system environment variable like "C:\Python\Python38-32\".
2. To launch ONA, cygwin should be installed and added to the PATH variable like "C:\cygwin64\bin".
3. To launch OpenNARS, Java should be installed and added to the PATH variable like "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.2\bin".

## Launch
Open the command window under the directory of NARS-FighterPlane_v1.0 or NARS-FighterPlane_v2.0 and type `python plane_game.py opennars` or `python plane_game.py ONA`.
NARS-FighterPlane_v1.0 allows NARS to move left, move right and stay still while NARS-FighterPlane_v2.0 allows NARS to move left, move right, stay still and fire by itself.
